# Learn TypeScript

Types are used by the TypeScript compiler to analyze our code for errors. A type commonly has properties and methods.

Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase.

What is a type? A type is a shortcut to refer to the different properties and functions a value has. Source Udemy TypeScript: The Complete Developer's Guide.
In TypeScript, what has a type? Any value.

Why do we care about types? They give the TypeScript compiler information to analyze our code for errors.

Type Annotations. Code we add to tell TypeScript what type of value a variable will refer to.

Type Inference. Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable will refer to.

## IMPORTANT
When writing code, we want to avoid defining variables with 'any'. The point of TypeScript is to catch errors inside of our code editor which it does by knowing what types the variables are. If a variable is type 'any', TypeScript cannot do its job.
